Animal: Stonkasaurus
The Stonkasaurus is a beastly creature made from the tears of retail investors.
Its sole purppose on this earth is to short SPY.
Its instincts are comprised of quotes from The Big Short, and Wolf of Wall Street.
Do not attempt to face this creature, much like the creature from SCP it will
spell your demise.
