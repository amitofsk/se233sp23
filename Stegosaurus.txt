Stegosaurus' are dinosaurs that have been dead for a good bit of time. They are herbivores and have big spikes running down their spines. 

They have a brain the size of a walnut and they like to eat small rocks to help mash up the vegetables they ate.

They are the state dinosaur for Colorado and my personal favorite dinosaur.
